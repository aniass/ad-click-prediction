# Advertisement click prediction

## General info
The main aim of this project is prediction of the advertisement click using the machine learning.  Based on the historical data of advertisement clicks (user behaviour, user profile, etc.) we made a model to predict who is going to click ad on a website in the future. The analysis includes data analysis, data preparation and creation model by different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest and AdaBoost.

### Dataset
The dataset comes from Kaggle and can be find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/ctr-in-advertisement).
